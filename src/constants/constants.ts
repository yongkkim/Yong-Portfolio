  text: 'Back in high school, I was all about soccer, basketball, and anything active. Becoming a developer had never crossed my mind. My older brother, on the other hand, was completely different—always at his computer, coding for hours. I’d often hear him sigh in frustration or whoop in triumph whenever he solved a problem.\n\nWhen you see something so different from yourself, you either ignore it or get curious. For me, it was the latter. Over time, I started asking him what he was doing, and before I knew it, we were having conversations about computers and coding. One day, he showed me how to print "Hello, World!" and build a simple calculator.\n\nThat’s when I realized I was starting to enjoy it—solving problems, figuring things out, and even feeling that same mix of frustration and excitement. My brother’s influence played a big role in shaping my decision, and by the time I was in high school, I knew this was the path I wanted to take.',
